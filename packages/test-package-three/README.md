# `test-package-three`

An array of even numbers from 2 to 10 that is used to do things that I would try to explain to you but you just don't have the math to understand! Seriously if I told you, your brain would leak out of your ears and then I'd have to clean up the floor. And I don't have a mop right now.

## Usage

```
const testPackageThree = require('test-package-three');

// TODO: DEMONSTRATE API
```
